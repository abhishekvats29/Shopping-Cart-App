# Shopping Cart Application
## ReactJS-Redux Toolkit Shopping Cart: 
#### This project uses ReactJS and Redux Toolkit to build a shopping cart where users can add items, view their cart, and see the total amount deducted from their cart when they purchase items.

## Key Features:
#### Product Catalog: Displays available products with images, descriptions, and prices.
#### Add to Cart: Users can add items to their shopping cart.
#### Cart Management: Users can view their cart, update quantities, and remove items.
#### Order Summary: Provides a breakdown of items, quantities, and total cost.

## Technical Overview:
#### Frontend: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
#### State Management: Uses Redux to manage the global state of the cart, user info, and product listings.
#### Backend: Can be built with Node.js to handle product data, user authentication, and order processing.
#### Database: Uses MongoDB to store user data, product details, and order history.
#### API Integration: Connects to payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal for secure transactions.

### Building this app involves setting up components for the catalog, cart, and checkout, and connecting them with Redux to manage the state seamlessly. It's a great project to showcase your skills in building full-stack applications.
